        <p id="p1">On the week leading up to the 9th, I learned the basics to HTML. I learned how to create a basic webpage, using body text, headings, and images</p>

        <p id="p2">On the week leading up to the 19th, I learned the basics to CSS. CSS goes hand in hand with HTML, because you can use CSS to make an HTML webpage looks more visually appealing. That's what I did, by adding a background color, text color, bold and italics (using ids and classes), as well as what I already knew from HTML</p>
        
        <h3 class="h3" id="post3">Third post</h3>
        <h6 class="h6">Posted on Sep. 26th, 2021</h6>
        <p id="p3">On the week leading up to the 26th, I learned more HTML. During this lesson, I learned how to add links (internal <em>and</em> external), as well as how to add tables to display data. I also learned how to add comments that only I can see, because the browser won't display it on the webpage. </p>
